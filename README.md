### Description
In this application that I have created users can retreive employee information. The user can view a photo of the employee along with their name, phone number, email, and age. The user can filter the users by their names by typing in the search field, the feild will return the users who have the the letters in their name in the order that was entered. The user can also sort the users alphabetically by their first name from A-Z or Z-A by clicking the Name hedding in the table. Clicking on the users email will open their mailing application and allow them to send a message to that employee.
